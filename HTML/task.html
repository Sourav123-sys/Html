    <img style= "margin-left:400px" src="log.png">
    <p>Brazil is the most successful national team in the FIFA World Cup, being crowned winner five times: 
        <ul><li>1958</li>
        <li>1962</li>
        <li>1970</li>
        <li>1994</li>
        <li>2002</li></ul> The Seleção also has the best overall performance in the World Cup competition, both in proportional and absolute terms, with a record of 73 victories in 109 matches played, 124 goal difference, 237 points, and 18 losses.[13][14] It is the only national team to have played in all World Cup editions without any absence nor need for playoffs,[15] and the only national team to have won the World Cup on four different continents: once in Europe (1958 Sweden), once in South America (1962 Chile), twice in North America (1970 Mexico and 1994 United States), and once in Asia (2002 Korea/Japan). Brazil is also the most successful national team in the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, being the winner four times: 1997, 2005, 2009, 2013; and one of the most successful national teams in the Olympic tournament, winning gold medals twice, in 2016 and 2020. Thus, it shares with France and Argentina the feat of winning the three most important men's football titles overseen by FIFA: the World Cup, the Confederations Cup, and the Olympic tournament.[note 1]</p><br><br>
